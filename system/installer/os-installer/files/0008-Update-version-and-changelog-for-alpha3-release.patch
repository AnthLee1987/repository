-          <h4>A new version of Budgie</h4>
-          <p>This release includes Budgie v4, which now features a rundialog. You'll receive updates for Budgie Desktop first, as both Evolve OS and the Budgie desktop are developed in tandem. </p>
+          <h4>Shiny kernel</h4>
+          <p>This version of Evolve OS includes a very recent kernel version, 3.15.6, ensuring better hardware support.</p>

-          <h4>A few good taters..</h4>
-          <p>As well as addressing some basic bugs, we've included Gimp 2.8.10 for your pleasure, as well as GNOME Maps. Because knowing where you are is awesome.</p>
+          <h4>New X.Org Stack</h4>
+          <p>We've included X.Org 1.16.0 and MesaLib 10.2.4  in this release, again improving hardware support and improving performance across the board. All drivers have been updated to their latest versions, and LLVM3.4.2 is available by default to assist in non-GPU accelerated cases</p>

-            <h4>Installer fixes</h4>
-            <p>The installer now requires a lower-case username, as well as a minimum password length of 6 characters. In a future version of the installer guidelines will be clearly visible</p>
+            <h4>Updated to the GNOME 3.12.2 stack</h4>
+            <p>This release now includes the GNOME 3.12 stack, offering a far more polished experience. In September you'll automatically be updated to GNOME 3.14</p>

         <div class="col-lg-6">
-            <h4>Moar integration</h4>
-            <p>The desktop experience is somewhat more integrated now, enabling the use of traditional keybindings for the panel menu (Super_L) and the run dialog (ALT+F2).</p>
+            <h4>The last alpha..</h4>
+            <p>This release represents the last alpha we're publishing. We're moving into daily(-ish) builds until beta1, vastly accelerating the development rate of Evolve OS</p>
