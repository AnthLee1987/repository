Evolve OS Package Repo
----------------------

Packages provided in source form only.

* [ ] Split off fat packages (docs,locale*)
* [ ] Address rampant CVEs
* [ ] Incorporate Budgie Desktop
* [ ] Purge cruft from repos
* [ ] Go on a license hunt, validate all packages
* [ ] Integrate LSM
* [ ] Integrate Buxton for configurables (determine scope here)
* [ ] Update minimum amount of packages (.1 gnome releases)
* [ ] Clean up all specs and actions.py files

NOTE: There is little reason to update any package beyond security
or branch-backports! This means we *are staying with GNOME 3.10* !
